## 1️⃣ Introduction to JavaScript

### 🤔 What is JavaScript?

> JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a high-level, versatile, and interpreted programming language primarily known for its role in web development, where it's used to add interactivity to web pages. It is an essential part of the web trinity alongside HTML (structure/content) and CSS (presentation/style).

- Brief history 📜

> 1995: Brendan Eich, while working at Netscape, developed a scripting language in just 10 days. It was initially named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally, because of the growing popularity of Sun Microsystems' Java language, it was renamed JavaScript. The name is somewhat misleading since JavaScript and Java are fundamentally different.

> 1996-1997: Microsoft released its own version called JScript to avoid potential trademark issues. JavaScript was then standardized in the ECMA International standards organization, leading to the official name "ECMAScript" with JavaScript being the most well-known implementation of that standard.

> 2000s: Development of the Ajax programming technique enabled web pages to retrieve data without refreshing. This brought about a significant shift in web development, with JavaScript playing a major role in creating dynamic web apps.

> 2009: Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js, a runtime that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side, thus expanding the capabilities and uses of JavaScript beyond just web browsers.

> 2010s-Present: The development of numerous libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js has further solidified JavaScript's position in modern web development, both on the client and server side.

- Role in web development 🌐

> Client-side: Originally, JavaScript was solely a client-side language, running in web browsers. It's responsible for:
>
> - Interactivity: Form validation, pop-ups, sliders, dropdown menus, and more.
> - Dynamic Content Loading: Without needing a page reload (thanks to AJAX).
> - DOM Manipulation: Changing the structure, content, and styling of web pages in real-time.
> - Animations: Smooth transitions, fading, sliding, etc.

> Server-side: With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now also run on the server. This means:
>
> - Back-end Development: Building server logic, connecting to databases, handling API requests.
> - Full-stack Development: One language can be used across both front-end and back-end development.

- Difference between JavaScript and Java ☕️

> 1. Use Cases: Java is a general-purpose language, commonly used for large-scale applications, Android app development, and enterprise software. JavaScript, initially, was specifically for web browsers but has since expanded to servers and even desktop/mobile apps with platforms like Electron and React Native.
> 
> 2. Compilation & Interpretation: Java is a compiled language, meaning code is first transformed into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the JVM. JavaScript is typically interpreted, with the browser's engine (like V8 for Chrome) executing the code directly. However, with modern JS, there's often a compilation step involved (like JIT compilation) for performance reasons.
>
> 3. Concurrency: Java uses multi-threading to perform many tasks simultaneously. JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. The concept of the "Event Loop" is central to understanding JS concurrency.
>
> 4. Object-Oriented vs. Prototype-Based: While both languages support object-oriented programming, Java uses class-based (objects are created from classes) while JavaScript is prototype-based (objects can inherit directly from other objects).

### 🛠️ Setting Up the Environment

#### Browser tools (e.g., Chrome Developer Tools) 🖥️

> - Opening DevTools: Use Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac) or right-click on an element on the page and select "Inspect".
>
> - Console: This panel is where you can see log messages or run JavaScript. You can log messages using the console.log() function.
>
> - Elements: Shows the website's DOM. You can inspect and modify HTML and CSS in real-time.
>
> - Sources: View and debug your JavaScript code.

#### Running scripts 🏃‍♂️

> Inline: Inside an HTML document using the `<script>` tag.

```html
<script>
    console.log("Hello, World!");
</script>
```

> External: Linking an external .js file to your HTML.

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

> Console: Directly in the browser's DevTools console.

### ✍️ Basic Syntax

> Statements: In JavaScript, statements are commands to be executed by the web browser's built-in JavaScript engine. Each statement is executed by the browser in sequence, one after the other.

```javascript
let x = 5;     // Declare a variable named x and assign it the value 5
x = x + 1;     // Increment x by 1
console.log(x); // Output the value of x to the console
```

> Comments: Comments can be added to explain JavaScript code and to make it more readable. They can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternate code.

```javsacript
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */
```

> Identifiers: In JavaScript, identifiers are names given to different entities such as variables, functions, etc. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).

```javascript
let name;
let _name;
let $name;
let name123;
```

> Keywords: Keywords are reserved words in JavaScript. For example, let, const, function, return, etc. These words have a specific meaning in the language and can't be used as names of variables or functions.

---

## 2️⃣ Variables and Data Types

### 🏷️ Declaring Variables

> JavaScript offers multiple ways to declare variables:

> var: The old way of declaring variables. It's function-scoped and hoisted.

```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, World!";
```

> let: Introduced in ES6 (ES2015). It's block-scoped, which means it's limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression where it's defined.

```javascript
let myLet = "Hello, ES6!";
```

> const: Also introduced in ES6. Like let, it's block-scoped, but its value can't be reassigned after it's initially assigned. This doesn’t mean it’s immutable, especially if it's an object.

```javascript
const myConst = "I won't change!";
```

#### Variable naming conventions 📛

> CamelCase: The most common convention. The first letter of the first word is lowercase, but the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word starts with a capital letter.

```javascript
let thisIsCamelCase = true;
```

> - Names should be descriptive: Instead of x or y, use names like counter or userName.
>
> - Start with letters, $, or _: Variables cannot start with numbers.
>
> - Avoid using JavaScript reserved keywords: Like function, return, etc.
>
> - Constants are typically in UPPERCASE: Especially for primitive constants.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
```

### 🔄 Data Types

> JavaScript has dynamic types, which means the same variable can be used to hold different data types. But at any given moment, a value has a specific type.

#### Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, BigInt, Symbol

> String: Represents textual data.

```javascript
let name = "John";
```

> Number: Represents numeric data. Both integers and floating-point numbers are the same type.

```javascript
let age = 25;     // Integer
```

let weight = 70.5; // Floating-point

> Boolean: Represents either true or false.

```javascript
let isOnline = true;
```

> null: Represents a null value, meaning no value or no object. It's intentional absence of any value.

```javascript
let nothing = null;
```

> undefined: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.

```javascript
let something;
```

console.log(something); // undefined

> BigInt: Represents whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1.

```javascript
const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

> Symbol: Represents a unique value that's not equal to any other value. Useful for object properties.

```javascript
const mySymbol = Symbol("description");
```

#### Objects 🗃️

> An object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

> **Simple Object**:

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true
};
```

> **Array**: A type of object used for storing multiple values in a single variable.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

> **Function**: Functions are objects too!

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

> **Date, RegExp, Error, and others**: These are other built-in object types in JavaScript.

## 3️⃣ Operators

### ➕ Arithmetic Operators

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`

### 🔄 Comparison Operators

- `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

### 🔡 Logical Operators

- `&&`, `||`, `!`

### 🖋️ Assignment Operators

- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

### 🔍 Other Operators

- Ternary, typeof, instanceof

---

## 4️⃣ Control Structures

> Control structures allow your program to make decisions and execute certain portions of code based on specific conditions. It's the foundation for writing dynamic programs that can adapt and react to different situations.

### 🚦 Conditional Statements

> Conditional statements evaluate if a condition is true or false and execute a specific block of code based on that.

#### `if`, `else`, `else if`

```javascript
let age = 18;
if (age < 18) {
    console.log("You're a minor!");
} else if (age === 18) {
    console.log("You're exactly 18!");
} else {
    console.log("You're an adult!");
}
```

#### Switch case

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
        console.log("It's an apple!");
        break;
    case "banana":
        console.log("It's a banana!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown fruit.");
}
```

### 🔄 Loops

> Loops repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition remains true.

#### `for`, `while`, `do..while`

> for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

> while loop: Executes a block of code while a condition is true.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

> do..while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes it while a condition is true.

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

#### Iterating over arrays: `for..of`, `forEach`

> for..of loop: Iterates over the values of an iterable object (like an array or string). The `for..of loop` is a modern way to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, and some other data structures.

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
// Outputs:
// apple
// banana
// cherry
```

> forEach loop: Executes a provided function once for each array element.  `forEach()` is a method available on array objects. It allows you to run a function on each item in the array.

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
fruits.forEach(function(fruit, index) {
    console.log(`Fruit at position ${index} is ${fruit}`);
});
// Outputs:
// Fruit at position 0 is apple
// Fruit at position 1 is banana
// Fruit at position 2 is cherry
```

### 🐜 Error Handling and Debugging

#### `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `finally`

> try: This block contains the code that might throw an exception.

> catch: This block contains the code to handle the exception.

> throw: Use this to create custom exceptions.

> finally: This block contains the code that will run regardless of an exception being thrown or not.

```javascript
try {
    let num = prompt("Enter a number");
    if (isNaN(num)) throw "Not a number";
    console.log(`You entered: ${num}`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
} finally {
    console.log("Execution finished!");
}
```

#### Using console methods for debugging 🐞

>- console provides several methods to assist in debugging:

>- console.log(): Outputs a message to the console.

>- console.error(): Outputs an error message.

>- console.warn(): Outputs a warning message.

>- console.table(): Displays tabular data.

>- console.group() and console.groupEnd(): Group related messages together.

```javascript
console.log("This is a log message.");

console.error("This is an error message.");

console.warn("This is a warning message.");

let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    job: "Engineer"
};
console.table(person);

console.group("Transaction Details");
console.log("Date: 2023-10-10");
console.log("Amount: $100");
console.groupEnd();
```

---

## 5️⃣ Functions

### 📦 What is a Function?

> A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to modularize your code, promote code reuse, and make your code more readable.

#### Definition, declaration, and calling 📞

> Function Declaration (or Function Statement):

```javascript
function greet(name) {
   console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

> Function Expression:

```javascript
const greet = function(name) {
   console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};
```

> To call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses:

```javascript
greet("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

### 🎯 Function Parameters and Return

> Parameters: Functions can take parameters (also known as arguments) that provide inputs for the function's task.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

> Return: Functions can also return values using the return keyword. If no return statement is specified, or if there's no expression after the return keyword, the function returns undefined.

```javascript
const sum = add(2, 3);
console.log(sum); // Outputs: 5
```

### 🌐 Scope and Closures

> Scope: In JavaScript, each function has its own scope. Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from outside the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined. This includes its own scope.

```javascript
let globalVar = "I'm global!";

function showScope() {
    let localVar = "I'm local!";
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
    console.log(localVar); // Accessible
}

showScope();
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

#### Closures:

> - At its core, a closure ([Toddler Explanation](#closure-toddler-explanation)) is a function bundled with its lexical environment ([Toddler Explanation](#lexical-environment-toddler-explanation)). In simple words, closures allow a function to access and interact with variables that are outside of its direct scope.

##### How Do Closures Work?

> - In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed around as arguments, and returned from other functions.
> - Every time a function is created, it retains a reference to its surrounding (lexical) environment—this includes any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.
> - When you call a function outside its original scope but it references variables from its original scope, you're working with a closure.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I'm outside!";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // This function is a closure
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const myClosure = outerFunction();
myClosure(); // Logs: "I'm outside!"
```

> In the above example, `outerVariable` is not in the scope of `myClosure` when we call it. However, because `innerFunction` was declared within `outerFunction` and has access to `outerVariable`, when we call `myClosure()`, it logs the value of `outerVariable`.

##### Why Are Closures Useful?

> 1. Data Encapsulation and Privacy: Closures can be used to mimic private variables in JavaScript, a feature the language doesn't inherently possess.
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
        },
        decrement: function() {
            count--;
        },
        getCount: function() {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
console.log(counter.count); // undefined
//Here, count acts as a private variable. We can't directly access it 
//from the outside, but we can manipulate it using the methods provided.
```

> 2. Event Listeners and Callbacks: Closures are often used in event listeners and callbacks, allowing access to variables at the time of their declaration.
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i); // This will log 3, 3 times.
    }, 1000);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i); // This will log 0, then 1, then 2.
    }, 1000);
}
```
> In the first loop, by the time the setTimeout callback is executed, i has already incremented to 3. In the second loop, using let in the loop provides a new binding for i with each iteration, effectively creating a new closure for each callback.

> 3. Functional Programming: Closures play a foundational role in functional programming in JavaScript, allowing the creation of factory functions, currying, etc.
```javascript
function multiplier(factor) {
    return function(x) {
        return x * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

### 🔥 ES6 Features

#### Arrow functions 🏹

> Arrow functions are a shorthand way to write functions in ES6 and beyond. They are especially useful for short, one-line functions.

> Syntax:
```javascript
const functionName = (param1, param2, ...) => expression;
```
> The body of the function is the right side of the arrow (`=>`). If the function has a single expression, you don't need curly braces (`{}`), and the expression will be implicitly returned.

>1. Basic arrow function
```javascript
const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greet('Alice')); // "Hello, Alice!"
```
>2. Arrow function with multiple parameters
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3));  // 5
```
>3. Arrow function with no parameters
```javascript
const getRandomNumber = () => Math.random();
```
>4. Arrow function with a block body
```javascript
const greet = name => {
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    console.log(greeting);
    return greeting;
};
```
>5. Arrow function and `this` ([Toddler Explanation](#arrow-function-and-this--toddler-explanation))
```javascript
function Timer() {
    this.seconds = 0;
    setInterval(function tick() {
        this.seconds++;
        console.log(this.seconds);
    }, 1000);
}

const timer = new Timer();  // NaN, NaN, NaN...

// The tick function inside setInterval gets its own this context, 
// which is not the same as the Timer object. 
// Therefore, this.seconds is NaN inside the tick function.

function Timer() {
    this.seconds = 0;
    setInterval(() => {
        this.seconds++;
        console.log(this.seconds);
    }, 1000);
}

const timer = new Timer();  // 1, 2, 3...

// In this case, the arrow function doesn't bind its own this, 
// so it uses the this value from the surrounding Timer function.
```
> In traditional functions, the value of this is determined by how the function is called. This is known as dynamic context.

> Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they capture the `this` value from their surrounding context when they're created. This is often called lexical scoping.

##### Differences from Traditional functions
>
>- Shorter Syntax: Arrow functions can be more concise.
>
>- No `this` Binding: Arrow functions don’t bind their own `this`. They inherit the `this` value from the surrounding code.
>
>- No arguments Object: Arrow functions don't have their own arguments object. They inherit it from the enclosing function.
>
>- No Constructor: Arrow functions can’t be used as constructors with the new keyword.
>
>- No prototype Property: Since they can’t be used as constructors, they don’t have a prototype property.

#### Default parameters 📋

> You can set default values for function parameters in ES6. If the function is called without a particular argument, it will use the default value.

```javascript
function greet(name = "World") {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet();        // Outputs: Hello, World!
greet("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

#### Rest and spread operators 🔄

> Rest Operator: It allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

```javascript
function displayNumbers(...nums) {
    console.log(nums);
}
displayNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

> Spread Operator: It allows you to spread an array (or other iterable) into individual elements.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(arr2); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## 6️⃣ Objects and Arrays
> JavaScript objects are essentially collections of key-value pairs. Keys are strings (or Symbols), and values can be anything: numbers, strings, functions, other objects.
### 📦 Creating Objects

#### Object literals, constructors 🛠️

> Object literals
```javascript
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
};
```
> Constructors
```javascript
let person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 30;
```

### 🏷️ Properties and Methods
>Properties in objects are essentially variables within that object.

> Accessing properties:
```javascript
console.log(person.firstName); // John
console.log(person["lastName"]); // Doe
```
>Adding properties:
```javascript
person.country = "USA";
```
>Methods:
```javascript
person.fullName = function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};

console.log(person.fullName()); // John Doe
```
### 📑 Array Basics

#### Creation, methods, and properties

### 🔍 Iterating Over Arrays and Objects
#### Arrays
> 1. The Classic `for` Loop

> 2. The `for..of` Loop
```javascript
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}
```
> 3. The `forEach` method
```javascript
fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
    console.log(fruit);
});

// Or, using an arrow function:
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log(fruit));

```
#### Objects
> 1. The Classic `for...in` Loop
```javascript
let person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 25,
    profession: 'developer'
};

for (let key in person) {
    if (person.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // Ensures only own properties are considered
        console.log(key, person[key]);
    }
}
```
> 2. Object methods

>- Object.keys(): Returns an array of an object's keys.
>
>- Object.values(): Returns an array of an object's values.
>
>- Object.entries(): Returns an array of key-value pairs.

> 3. Iterating with `for...of` and `Object.entries()`
```javascript
for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(person)) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
```

## 7️⃣ The Document Object Model (DOM)
> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. Each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element or an attribute. In simpler terms, the DOM is a structured representation of the content in a web page.

> Imagine you've written an HTML document. Once the browser reads that document, it creates a representation of the document in memory, and that's the DOM. This representation is a hierarchical structure, much like a tree, where each node is an object representing part of the document.
### 📜 What is the DOM?

#### Relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
>JavaScript can:
>
>Read the DOM: For instance, find out what text is inside a certain element.
>
>Modify the DOM: Like changing the content of an element, which updates what a user sees on the web page.
>   
>Listen for events on the DOM: Such as a button being clicked or a form being submitted.
### 🔍 Selecting Elements

#### By ID, class, tag name, query selectors 🏷️

> `getElementById()`: Returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value.

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div id="uniqueID">Hello, World!</div>
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
let element = document.getElementById('uniqueID');
console.log(element.textContent);  // Outputs: Hello, World!
```
> `getElementsByClassName()`: Returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified class name, as a NodeList object.

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="commonClass">First</div>
<div class="commonClass">Second</div>
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName('commonClass');
for(let el of elements) {
    console.log(el.textContent);  // Outputs: First, then Second
}
```
> `getElementsByTagName()`: Returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified tag name, as a NodeList object.

```javascript
<!-- HTML -->
<p>First paragraph.</p>
<p>Second paragraph.</p>

// JavaScript
let paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
for(let p of paragraphs) {
    console.log(p.textContent);
}
```
> `querySelector()`: Returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.
> 
> `querySelectorAll()`: Returns all elements that match a specified CSS selector(s) in the document, as a static NodeList object.

```javascript
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="sample">A</div>
<p class="sample">B</p>

// JavaScript
let firstSample = document.querySelector('.sample'); // Returns the first element with class "sample"
console.log(firstSample.textContent); // Outputs: A

let allSamples = document.querySelectorAll('.sample'); // Returns all elements with class "sample"
allSamples.forEach(el => console.log(el.textContent)); // Outputs: A, then B
```
> Differences between HTMLCollection and NodeList:
> - `getElementsByClassName` and `getElementsByTagName` return a live HTMLCollection. This means if the DOM updates (like if an element is added or removed), the collection will immediately reflect these changes.
> 
> - `querySelectorAll`, however, returns a static NodeList. It doesn't update if the DOM changes.
>
> - Note: While NodeList and HTMLCollection might seem like arrays, they aren't. They do have a `length` property, but for methods like `forEach`, only NodeList from `querySelectorAll` has it. For HTMLCollection, you'd typically convert it to an array first or use a for loop.


### ✍️ Modifying the DOM

#### Changing content, attributes, and styles 🎨

> 1. Changing content: `textContent`, `innerHTML`, `innerText`

> 2. Changing attributes: `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`
>
> Real world scenarios: Form input validation, Dynamic themes and Analytics & Tracking
> 
> getAttribute(): Retrieve the value of a specified attribute from an element.
```html
<!-- HTML -->
<a href="https://www.example.com" id="myLink">Visit Example</a>
```
```javascript
// Javascript
let linkElement = document.getElementById("myLink");
let hrefValue = linkElement.getAttribute("href");
console.log(hrefValue);  // Outputs: "https://www.example.com"
```
> setAttribute(): Set the value of a specified attribute on an element. If the attribute doesn't exist, it will be added with the specified value.
```javascript
// Javscript
let linkElement = document.getElementById("myLink");
linkElement.setAttribute("href", "https://www.openai.com");
```

> 3. Changing styles: `style`

```javascript
let div = document.querySelector("div");

// Setting individual styles
div.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
div.style.fontSize = "20px";

// Setting multiple styles at once using CSSText
div.style.cssText = "background-color: red; font-size: 25px;";
```
> 4. Example using class
```javascript
// JavaScript
div.classList.add("active");

// CSS
.active {
    background-color: green;
    font-size: 30px;
}
```
> 5. Adding and Removing Nodes:
> 
> - appendChild: Adds a new child node at the end.
>
> - insertBefore: Inserts a node before another node.
>
> - removeChild: Removes a child node.
```javascript
let parent = document.querySelector(".parent");
let newElement = document.createElement("div");

// Appending new element
parent.appendChild(newElement);

// Inserting new element before the first child
parent.insertBefore(newElement, parent.firstChild);

// Removing a child
parent.removeChild(newElement);
```

## 8️⃣ Events

### 🚦 Understanding Events
> What is an Event?
> 
> In the context of the Document Object Model (DOM), an event is any significant occurrence or change, often triggered by users interacting with a web page. For instance, clicking a button, moving the mouse, or pressing a key can all trigger events.
>
> Why are Events important?
>
> 1. Interactivity: Events allow web pages to respond to user actions, making them interactive. Without events, web pages would be static and wouldn't offer dynamic user experiences.
>
>2. Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript's event-driven nature means that actions can occur out of sequence, allowing for more efficient code execution.
>
>3. Feedback: By listening for and responding to events, developers can provide feedback to users, enhancing user experience.
>
> **Event Handling:**
>
> 1. Listening: You set up event listeners to "wait" for a specific event to occur on a target element.
> 
> 2. Responding: Once the event is detected, a function (often called an event handler or callback) is executed in response.
```javascript
buttonElement.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Button was clicked!');
});
```

### 📣 Event Listeners

> Mouse events: 
> 
> - `click`: Triggered when an element is clicked.
>
> - `mousedown`: Triggered when a mouse button is pressed down.
>
> - `mouseup`: Triggered when a mouse button is released.
>
> - `mousemove`: Triggered when the mouse is moved.
>
> - `mouseover`: Triggered when the mouse enters an element's area.
>
> - `mouseout`: Triggered when the mouse leaves an element's area.
```javascript
element.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
    element.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
});
```
> Keyboard events:
>
> - `keydown`: Triggered when a key is pressed.
> 
> - `keyup`: Triggered when a key is released.
> 
> - `keypress`: Triggered when a key is pressed and then released.
```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        console.log('Enter key pressed!');
    }
});
```
> Form events:
>
> - `submit`: Triggered when a form is submitted.
> 
> - `change`: Triggered when the value of an input or select box changes.
> 
> - `focus`: Triggered when an element receives focus.
> 
> - `blur`: Triggered when an element loses focus.

```javascript
formElement.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevents form submission
    console.log('Form submitted!');
});
```
> Window events:
>
> - load: Triggered when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading.
> 
> - resize: Triggered when the window is resized.
> 
> - scroll: Triggered when the window is scrolled.
```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
    console.log('Window was resized!');
});
```

### 🌊 Event Propagation

> Event propagation in the context of the Web browsers describes the order in which event listeners are invoked for an element which received an event. 
> >There are three main phases:
> >
> > 1. Capturing (or Capture) Phase: The event starts from the root and trickles down to the target element.
> >
> > 2. Target Phase: The event reaches the target element.
> >
> > 3. Bubbling Phase: The event bubbles up from the target element back to the root.
>
> Why is it imporant?
> 
> Imagine you have a button inside a div. Both elements have a click event listener. When you click the button, both listeners will be invoked due to event propagation. By understanding the propagation process, you can control which listeners get invoked and in what order.

## Toddler Explanations

### Lexical environment: Toddler explanation
[⬆️ Closures](#closures)
> Imagine you have a toy box. Inside this toy box, you have smaller toy boxes, and inside those smaller toy boxes, you might have even smaller ones. Each box contains toys. If a toy isn’t in one box, you would look in the bigger box that contains it, and if it's not there, you'd continue looking in an even bigger box, and so on.

> <img src = "./images/image_2.png">

> Now, let's relate this to JavaScript:

> - Each toy box is like a function in JavaScript.
> - The toys inside each box are like the variables and inner functions inside that function.
> - If a smaller box (function) needs a toy (variable) and doesn't find it inside, it will check the bigger box (outer function) it's inside. If it's still not there, it'll continue checking in even bigger boxes until it finds the toy or reaches the largest box.
> - In JavaScript, this idea of looking for a toy (variable) from a smaller box (function) to bigger boxes (outer functions) is what's called the "lexical environment". "Lexical" basically means "related to words or reading", so when we talk about the lexical environment in JavaScript, we’re talking about where things were written (or where boxes are placed) and how they can access toys (variables).

> So, when a function (small box) wants to use a variable (toy), it first checks its own box. If it doesn't find the toy, it checks the bigger box it's in. If it's still not there, it checks an even bigger box, and this goes on until it finds the toy or reaches the biggest box (global environment).

> In summary, the lexical environment is like a system of boxes within boxes, where each box (function) knows about the toys (variables) inside it and inside the bigger boxes that contain it.

### Closure: Toddler explanation
[⬆️ Closures](#closures)
> Imagine you have a magic toy chest in your room. Whenever you put a toy into this chest and close it, the toy inside gains a superpower: it can remember and use all the other toys and tools from your room, even if you take the toy chest to another room or even outside the house!

> <img src = "./images/image_1.png">

> However, here's the trick: the toys in the other rooms or outside don't know anything about your room or its special tools. Only the toy in the magic toy chest has this special ability to remember your room's toys and tools.

> Now, let's translate this to JavaScript and closures:

> 1. Your room = A function where you declare some variables (toys and tools).
> 2. Magic toy chest = Another function inside the bigger function (your room).
> 3. Taking the magic toy chest to another room or outside = When you return the inner function (magic toy chest) and use it somewhere else in your code.
> 4. Toy inside the magic toy chest remembering your room's toys and tools = A closure, which allows the inner function (the toy in the chest) to remember and use variables (toys and tools) from the outer function (your room), no matter where you use it.

### Arrow function and `this` : Toddler explanation
[⬆️ Arrow functions](#arrow-functions-🏹)
>Imagine you're in a library (which is a big function). Each section in the library is like a smaller function within the big function. The library has a rule: "Speak in the language you hear the most around you."

><img src="./images/image_3.png">

>You (the this keyword) adapt your behavior based on where you are:

>Traditional Function: When you move to different sections of the library (functions), you might start speaking different languages, because each section might have people speaking different languages. It's dynamic and changes based on the section (how the function is called).

>Arrow Function: But let's say you're wearing headphones (you're inside an arrow function). Instead of listening to the current section's language, you always listen to a podcast in your native language. No matter where you go in the library, you keep speaking your native language, because that's what you hear in your headphones. Arrow functions, like headphones, keep the language (or this context) from where they were first placed (created).
